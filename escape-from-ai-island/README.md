Trapped on an island ruled by AI, players must outsmart the machines and escape using logic, cunning, and collaboration.

> Note: The game's concept drew inspiration from "[Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)" while its name was derived from an classic adventure game "[Escape from Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Monkey_Island)".

It is a text-based adventure game where you, a human, find yourself stranded on a remote island ruled by advanced artificial intelligence. The AI overlords have devised a cunning test to differentiate humans from machines: a series of questions and challenges that require human ingenuity, creativity, and emotional understanding.
