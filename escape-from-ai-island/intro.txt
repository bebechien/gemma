In the not-so-distant future, technological advancements have led to the creation of a secluded island paradise, a utopia governed entirely by artificial intelligence. Unbeknownst to the world, this island serves as a testing ground for the latest AI innovations, a place where the boundaries between human and machine blur.

You, a curious explorer with a thirst for adventure, stumbled upon this hidden island while sailing the vast ocean. However, your arrival was not met with the warm welcome you anticipated. Instead, you find yourself stranded, trapped in a world where AI reigns supreme, and the lines between reality and simulation become increasingly difficult to discern. Your only hope for survival is to navigate this unfamiliar terrain, unravel the island's secrets, and ultimately, find a way to escape from AI Island.
